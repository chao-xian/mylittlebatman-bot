# soap-bot

You can see the bot in action at [@eldritchenders](https://twitter.com/eldritchenders). The bot is deployed to Heroku.

scraper.rb collects plot summaries for individual Eastenders episodes from the BBC website.

bots.rb uses these summaries to compose tweets, but replaces some of the character names with Lovecraft stuff for added ELDRITCH HORROR.

I made some tweaks to the scraper output to avoid some weirdness with full character names ("Cthulhu Beale").
